## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis and visualization solution based on the **Ford GoBike System Data**. 
The project is divided into three main phases:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis inside a polished Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:** Cleaning data, handling missing values, and engineering new features (e.g., trip duration in minutes, age groups).
3. **Interactive Dashboard:** A dynamic web application featuring KPIs, time analysis, user behavior analysis, and station analysis with dynamic filters.

## Team & Collaboration
This project is developed by a dedicated team of 6 members divided into two specialized squads:
- **Team 1 (Data & Notebook):** Responsible for data cleaning, feature engineering, and extracting insights.
- **Team 2 (Interactive Dashboard):** Responsible for UI/UX, interactivity (callbacks), and Plotly visualizations.

> **Important:** Please check [`TEAM_TASKS.md`](TEAM_TASKS.md) for current task assignments and progress.

### Contribution Rules
We follow a strict Git Workflow to maintain code quality:
1. **Never push directly to `main`**.
2. Work on separate branches (`feature/task-name` or `bugfix/issue-name`).
3. All PRs must be reviewed and approved by the Team Leader.
> Read the full rules in our [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
